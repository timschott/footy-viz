			<p>In international soccer, teams don't have very much time to practice together, so the abilities of individuals often ends up deciding games. For this reason, we want to explore the statistics and performances of 3 key players. Their performance in the World Cup, we believe, hinges on the performances of these players.</p>

			<p>Before cracking into these key players, it's important to review some of the basics of the game of soccer and the types of tournaments teams compete in.</p>
			<p>For those already familiar with soccer, feel free to skip ahead to the <a href="#tactics">Tactics</a> section.</p>
			<p>Each team has 11 players. There are two 45 minute halves. The purpose of the game is to score goals against the opposition. Whoever has the most goals at the end of the game wins. It's illegal to use your hands, of course -- which is why most other countries refer to the game as "football."</p>
			<p>Besides the goalkeeper, players fall into 3 broad categories. <i>Forwards</i> are the goal scorers who are the best at shooting and scoring goals. <i>Defenders</i> protect their goal and try to stop opposition forwards from advancing. <i>Midfielders</i> occupy the middle of the field and try to link together the work from their team's defense and make opportunities for the forwards to score.</p>
			<p>Each country organizes its soccer teams into a system of "leagues" similar to the NFL. For example, in England their top soccer league is the "Premier League" and in Germany it is the "Bundesliga." Within those leagues, the teams are typically referred to as <i>clubs</i>.</p>
			<p>The best players from across the world receive the honor to play for their country of origin's <i>national team</i>. The dynamics of each national team are fascinating, then, because players whose "day-jobs" are quite different from one another have to coalesce in short stints of "international breaks" throughout the club soccer season.</p>
			<p>Winning the World Cup is the crown jewel for national teams. It's played every 4 years, and is the most-watched and most-prestigious sporting event in the world.</p> 
			<p>Besides the World Cup, another major tournament England competes in is the European Cup ("The Euros") which is also played every 4 years.</p>
			<p>To get a better sense of what a soccer team looks lke in action, we're going to introduce a standard "tactics" boards and few videos from matches.</p>

			<p>It's common to classify the way that teams arrange their players into a <i>lineup</i>. These clips show different strategies, with Manchester City adopting something like a "4-5-1" and Hoffenheim adopting a "3-5-2." To interpret these labels, you read from left to right with the left most number representing the number of defenders. For instance, Manchester City used <b>4</b> defenders, <b>5</b> midfielders, and <b>1</b> forward.</p> 
			<p>The choice of lineup is quite important because it implicates which players will be selected; you cannot have a team with 11 defenders running around. For national teams like England, the problem is magnified because every player is phenomenal. So, before exploring the strengths of our key players, we want to consider the best lineup choice for England.</p>

England scored a goal 2 minutes after kickoff, but managed just 1 shot on target the rest of the match. Trent-Alexander Arnold did not play, while <span id ='red-span'>Mason Mount</span> and <span id ='red-span'>Harry Kane</span> (highlighted in <span id ='red-span'>red</span>) performed poorly. This formation is relatively conservative, especially given the players England used. They fielded a team with 5 defenders instead of the usual 4. Their outside defenders (Shaw and Trippier) were tasked with shutting down wide options for Italy. This left England with scant attacking options.</p>

			<p>Harry Kane boasts an impressive career for both club and country. At just 28 years of age he has already climbed England's goal-scoring ranks, boasting the third most goals in history for their national team.</p>
			<p>His playing style can be described as the perfect mixture of pragmatism and athleticism. His large frame lets him excel in aerial duels, yet his excellent footwork and great passing ability allows him to easily incorporate his teammates into attacking plays. He is far and away England's most important player. </p>

			<p>Going forward, England would do well to utilize his creativity by continuing to entrust him with the responsibility of creating scoring chances for strikers like Kane. Plus, as he continues to develop and gain experience, he'll also improve as a shooter and start to score goals of his own.</p>
